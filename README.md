# Storing workflow data as artifacts

Artifacts allow you to share data between jobs in a workflow and store data once that workflow has completed.

## Description

### Artifacts

Files or collections of files produced during a workflow run that can be shared between jobs or downloaded after the run.

### Usage and billing

Artifacts are stored on GitHub for a default or custom retention period and use storage space that may affect billing.

### Uploading and downloading artifacts

You can use the upload-artifact and download-artifact actions to upload and download artifacts within a workflow run.

### Sharing data between jobs

You can use artifacts to pass data between jobs in a workflow, such as build output or test reports.
